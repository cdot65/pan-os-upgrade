<a href="https://github.com/cdot65/pan-os-upgrade" target="_blank">pan-os-upgrade</a> is a modern Python CLI tool that provides a comprehensive automated workflow for PAN-OS firewalls. It offers two primary methods of execution: through a Python virtual environment or via a Docker container, catering to various operational requirements and preferences.

## Python Virtual Environment Workflow

This approach involves setting up a Python virtual environment and running `pan-os-upgrade` within this isolated environment, ensuring compatibility and preventing any conflicts with system-wide Python installations.

### Python Key Features

- Easy and isolated Python environment setup.
- Full control over the Python version and dependencies.
- Ideal for users familiar with Python and virtual environments.

### Python Getting Started

Install `pan-os-upgrade` via pip in a Python virtual environment and configure it using command-line arguments or an interactive shell. Detailed instructions can be found in the [User Guide](user-guide/python/getting-started.md).

## Docker Container Workflow

Running `pan-os-upgrade` in a Docker container encapsulates the tool and its dependencies in an isolated environment, simplifying setup and ensuring consistency across different systems.

### Docker Key Features

- Simplified setup process with Docker.
- Consistent runtime environment regardless of the host system.
- Suitable for users who prefer Docker or require containerized environments.

### Docker Getting Started

Pull the `pan-os-upgrade` Docker image, run the container with mounted directories for outputs, and interact with the tool in an isolated environment. More information is available in the [User Guide](user-guide/docker/getting-started.md).

Visit the [User Guide](user-guide/introduction.md) for detailed insights into setting up and running `pan-os-upgrade` using either Python or Docker workflows.

## Example

<div class="termy">

```console
pan-os-upgrade batch
Panorama hostname or IP: panorama.cdot.io
Panorama username: cdot
Panorama password:
Firewall target version (ex: 10.1.2): 10.2.3
Filter string (ex: hostname=Woodlands*) []: hostname=Woodlands*
Dry Run? [y/N]:
