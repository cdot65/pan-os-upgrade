<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

`pan-os-upgrade` is designed to provide network administrators and security professionals with an efficient tool to execute configuration backups, network state snapshots, system readiness checks, and operating system upgrades of Palo Alto Networks firewalls and Panorama appliances.

<!-- SUPPORT -->
## Support

For details on the support provided by Palo Alto Networks for this project, please consult the [SUPPORT.md](https://github.com/cdot65/pan-os-upgrade/blob/main/SUPPORT.md) file in the repository.

<!-- KEY FEATURES -->
### Key Features

- **Three Unique Upgrade Workflows Supported**:
  - `firewall`: targets and upgrades an individual PAN-OS firewall
  - `panorama`: targets and upgrades an individual Panorama appliance
  - `batch`: targets a Panorama appliance and upgrades firewalls in bulk
- **Automation of Routine Tasks**: Reduces manual errors and saves time by automating upgrades, configurations, and system checks.
- **Support for Direct and Proxy Connections**: Connect directly to firewalls or through a Panorama appliance, with support for targeting specific devices using filters.
- **Pre/Post Diff**: Network snapshots are taken before and after the upgrade process, providing a PDF report of changes within the network environment after the upgrade completes.
- **Active/Passive High Availability (HA) Workflow**: Fully supports upgrading devices in active/passive HA configurations when executed in `batch` mode, ensuring both members are properly upgraded and synchronized.
- **Multi-threading for Efficiency**: Utilizes multi-threading to parallelize upgrades, especially beneficial when upgrading multiple devices through Panorama, enhancing performance and reducing overall upgrade time.
- **Customizable and Extensible**: Execution of the script can be tailored to fit diverse network environments and requirements, offering flexibility for various deployment scenarios.
- **Comprehensive PAN-OS Interactions**: Facilitates extensive interactions with Palo Alto Networks appliances for operations like readiness checks, state snapshots, and report generation.

> **Note**: While this script is optimized for standalone and active/passive HA environments, it has not been tested against active/active or clustered firewalls.

<!-- LOGIC WORKFLOW -->
### Logic Workflow

You can view the logical workflow of the `pan-os-upgrade` subcommands by viewing these diagrams:

- [pan-os-upgrade firewall](https://link.excalidraw.com/readonly/JYX3bXR6dS8Eoejmpcfx?darkMode=true)
- [pan-os-upgrade panorama](https://link.excalidraw.com/readonly/lFTV51plR0DBR5FdkC5Y?darkMode=true)
- [pan-os-upgrade batch](https://link.excalidraw.com/readonly/hNOeOAWRlk4t9uKBfPVE?darkMode=true)

<!-- EXAMPLE EXECUTION -->
### Example Execution

<div class="termy">

```console
❯ pan-os-upgrade batch
Panorama hostname or IP: panorama1.cdot.io
Panorama username: officehours
Panorama password:
Firewall target version (ex: 10.1.2): 10.1.3-h3
Dry Run? [Y/n]: n
=================================================================================================
Welcome to the PAN-OS upgrade tool

This script software is provided on an 'as-is' basis with no warranties, and no support provided.

The selected `batch` subcommand will upgrade one or more firewalls.

Settings: No settings.yaml file was found, default values will be used.
You can create a settings.yaml file with 'pan-os-upgrade settings' command.

Inventory: No inventory.yaml file was found, firewalls will need be selected through the menu.
You can create an inventory.yaml file with 'pan-os-upgrade inventory' command.
=================================================================================================
