<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project is a comprehensive Python-based solution for automating PAN-OS upgrades. It's designed to provide network administrators and security professionals with an efficient tool to manage upgrades, configurations, and system checks of Palo Alto Networks appliances.

Key Features:

* Automates routine tasks, reducing manual errors and saving time.
* Connect to firewalls directly or through a Panorama appliance as a proxy.
* Customizable scripts to fit various network environments and requirements.
* Extensive interaction with Palo Alto Networks appliances for operations like readiness checks, state snapshots, and report generation.

> Note: this script is targeted towards standalone and `active-passive` HA environments, no testing has been performed against `active-active` or clustered firewalls.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

There are two primary methods to utilize the `pan-os-upgrade` tool: through a Python virtual environment or via a Docker container. Both methods are outlined below to cater to different preferences or requirements.

### Running with Python Virtual Environment

This approach involves setting up a Python virtual environment on your local machine and running the `pan-os-upgrade` tool within this isolated environment.

#### Python Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or newer.
* Access to a Palo Alto Networks firewall.
* An active internet connection to download the package from PyPI.

#### Installation

The `pan-os-upgrade` library is available on PyPI and can be installed within a Python virtual environment. A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that contains a Python installation for a particular version of Python, plus a number of additional packages.

##### Creating a Python Virtual Environment

The steps below highlight the process for creating, activating, and installing `pan-os-upgrade` into a Python virtual environment. If you're new to Python, it may be beneficial to understand why this is such an important step, [here is a good writeup](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) to prime yourself.

1. Create a Virtual Environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv panos_env
    ```

    This command creates a new directory panos_env which contains a copy of the Python interpreter, the standard library, and various supporting files.

2. Activate the Virtual Environment:

    On Windows:

    ```bash
    panos_env\Scripts\activate
    ```

    On macOS and Linux:

    ```bash
    source panos_env/bin/activate
    ```

    After activation, your command line will indicate that you are now in the virtual environment.

3. Install `pan-os-upgrade`:

    Within the activated environment, use pip to install the package:

    ```bash
    pip install pan-os-upgrade
    ```

#### Setting Up Your Environment

After setting up the virtual environment and installing the package, you can configure your environment to use the library. This can be done using command-line arguments or using the interactive shell.

##### Option 1: Execute `pan-os-upgrade` without Command-Line Arguments

You can simply get started by issuing `pan-os-upgrade` from your current working directory, you will be guided to input the missing requirement arguments through an interactive shell.

```console
$ pan-os-upgrade

Username: cdot

```

As an alternative to targeting firewalls directly, you can target a Panorama appliance to act as the communication proxy. If you'd like to go down this path, make sure that you add an extra CLI option of `--filter` and pass a string representation of your filter.

As of version 0.2.5, the available filters are:

| filter type | description                                       | example                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| hostname    | use the firewall's hostname as selection criteria | `--filter "hostname=houston"`       |
| serial      | use the firewall's serial as selection criteria   | `--filter "serial=007054000123456"` |

```console
$ pan-os-upgrade --filter 'hostname=houston'
Hostname or IP: panorama.cdot.io
Username: cdot

##### Option 2: Execute `pan-os-upgrade` Using Command-Line Arguments

Alternatively, you can pass these details as command-line arguments when running the script:

```bash
pan-os-upgrade --hostname 192.168.1.1 --username admin --password secret --version 10.1.0
```

For a dry run:

```bash
pan-os-upgrade --hostname 192.168.1.1 --username admin --password secret --version 10.1.0 --dry-run
```

If you're targeting a Panorama appliance to act as a proxy for communications to the firewall, make sure you also pass a filter pattern:

```bash
pan-os-upgrade --hostname panorama.cdot.io --username admin --password secret --version 10.1.0 --filter "hostname=houston"
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Running with Docker

Alternatively, you can run `pan-os-upgrade` as a Docker container. This method ensures that the tool runs in an isolated environment with all its dependencies packaged together.

#### Docker Prerequisites

* Docker installed on your system. You can download it from [Docker's official site](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

#### Pulling the Docker Image

First, pull the `pan-os-upgrade` image from GitHub Packages:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/cdot65/pan-os-upgrade:latest
```

#### Running the Container

To run the container and mount local directories for `assurance` and `logs`, use the following commands:

On macOS and Linux:

```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/assurance:/app/assurance -v $(pwd)/logs:/app/logs -it pan-os-upgrade
```

On Windows:

```bash
docker run -v %CD%/assurance:/app/assurance -v %CD%/logs:/app/logs -it pan-os-upgrade
```

These commands mount the current directory's `assurance` and `logs` subdirectories to the corresponding directories in the container. If these directories don't exist on your host, Docker will create them.

#### Interactive Mode

The container will start in interactive mode, prompting you for the necessary input like IP address, username, password, and target PAN-OS version.

#### Accessing Logs and Output

After the container stops, you can find the logs and other output files in the `assurance` and `logs` directories of your current working directory on your host machine.

<!-- OUTPUT -->
## Output

The script generates several files containing the state of the firewall and readiness checks. These files are stored in the `assurance` directory with the following structure:

* `snapshots`: Contains the pre and post-upgrade network state snapshots in JSON format.
* `readiness_checks`: Contains the results of readiness checks in JSON format.
* `configurations`: Contains the backup of the firewall's configuration in XML format.

<!-- LOGGING -->
## Logging

Log messages are printed to the console and saved to a rotating log file located in the `logs` directory. The log level can be set via the `--log-level` argument.

<!-- TROUBLESHOOTING -->
## Troubleshooting

Encountered an issue? Here are some common problems and solutions:

* **Problem**: Script fails to connect to the PAN-OS device.
  * **Solution**: Check if the hostname and credentials are correct. Ensure network connectivity to the PAN-OS device.

* **Problem**: Script hangs during execution.
  * **Solution**: Check the firewall and network settings. Ensure the PAN-OS device is responding correctly.
