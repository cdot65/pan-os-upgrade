def ha_sync_check_firewall(

) -> bool:
    """
    Checks the synchronization status between High Availability (HA) peers of a Palo Alto Networks device.

    Ensuring HA peers are synchronized is vital before executing operations that might impact the device's state,
    such as firmware upgrades or configuration changes. This function evaluates the HA synchronization status using
    provided HA details. It offers an option to enforce a strict synchronization check, where failure to sync
    results in script termination, ensuring operations proceed only in a fully synchronized HA environment.

    Parameters
    ----------
    hostname : str
        The hostname or IP address of the target device, used for logging purposes to identify the device under evaluation.
    ha_details : dict
        A dictionary containing HA information for the device, specifically the synchronization status with its HA peer.
    strict_sync_check : bool, optional
        If True (default), the function will exit the script upon detecting unsynchronized HA peers to prevent potential
        disruptions. If False, the script logs a warning but continues execution, suitable for less critical operations.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Returns True if the HA peers are confirmed to be synchronized, indicating readiness for sensitive operations.
        Returns False if the HA peers are not synchronized, with subsequent actions dependent on the `strict_sync_check` parameter.

    Raises
    ------
    SystemExit
        Triggered if `strict_sync_check` is True and the HA peers are found to be unsynchronized, halting the script to avoid
        potential issues in an unsynchronized HA environment.

    Example
    -------
    >>> ha_details = {'result': {'group': {'running-sync': 'synchronized'}}}
    >>> ha_sync_check_firewall('firewall1', ha_details)
    True  # Indicates that the HA peers are synchronized

    >>> ha_sync_check_firewall('firewall1', ha_details, strict_sync_check=False)
    False  # HA peers are unsynchronized, but script continues due to lenient check

    Notes
    -----
    - In HA configurations, maintaining synchronization between peers is critical to ensure consistent state and behavior
    across devices.
    - This function is particularly useful in automated workflows and scripts where actions need to be conditional on the
    synchronization state of HA peers to maintain system integrity and prevent split-brain scenarios.
    - The option to override strict synchronization checks allows for flexibility in operations where immediate consistency
    between HA peers may not be as critical.

    """
    Temporarily disables High Availability (HA) functionality on an active device within an HA configuration.

    In an HA setup, it may be necessary to suspend HA functionality on the active device to perform system upgrades or maintenance tasks without triggering failover to the passive device. This function sends an operational command to the target device to suspend HA, ensuring that the device remains in an active but non-failover state. It checks the command's success through the device's response and provides appropriate logging for the operation's outcome.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_device : Union[Firewall, Panorama]
        The device on which HA functionality is to be suspended. This must be an active device in an HA pair and can be either a Firewall or a Panorama appliance.
    hostname : str
        The hostname or IP address of the target device. This is used primarily for identification and logging purposes.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the command to suspend HA is successfully issued and acknowledged by the target device, indicating that HA functionality has been suspended. False if the command fails or the device response indicates an error.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        If the operational command to suspend HA fails or an unexpected response is received from the device, an exception is raised detailing the error encountered.

    Example
    -------
    Suspending HA functionality on an active device in an HA pair:
        >>> firewall = Firewall(hostname='192.168.1.1', api_username='admin', api_password='admin')
        >>> success = suspend_ha_active(firewall, '192.168.1.1')
        >>> if success:
        ...     print("HA suspension successful.")
        ... else:
        ...     print("HA suspension failed.")

    Notes
    -----
    - Suspending HA on the active device is a significant operation that should be performed with caution, particularly in a production environment, to avoid unintended service disruptions.
    - Ensure that the procedure for resuming HA functionality is planned and understood before suspending HA, as this will be necessary to restore full HA operational capabilities.

    hostname: str,

    """
    Temporarily disables High Availability (HA) functionality on the passive device within an HA pair.

    In an HA environment, it may become necessary to suspend HA functionality on the passive device to facilitate system upgrades or maintenance, ensuring the device does not unexpectedly become active. This function issues a command to the target device to suspend its HA functionality. The success of this operation is determined by the response from the device, and the outcome is logged for administrative review.

    Parameters
    ----------
    target_device : Union[Firewall, Panorama]
        The device on which HA functionality is to be suspended. This must be a passive device in an HA pair and can be either a Firewall or a Panorama appliance.
    hostname : str
        The hostname or IP address of the device. Used for identification and logging.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        True if the HA suspension command is successfully executed, indicating that HA functionality on the passive device has been temporarily disabled. False if the command execution fails or if the device response indicates an error.

    Raises
    ------
    Exception
        If the operational command to suspend HA fails or an unexpected response is received, an exception is logged detailing the encountered issue.

    Example
    -------
    Suspending HA on the passive device in an HA configuration:
        >>> panorama = Panorama(hostname='panorama.example.com', api_username='admin', api_password='admin')
        >>> success = suspend_ha_passive(panorama, 'panorama.example.com')
        >>> print("HA suspension successful" if success else "HA suspension failed")

    Notes
    -----
    - Suspending HA on a passive device is a critical operation that should be carefully planned and executed, particularly in live environments, to avoid unintended failovers or service disruptions.
    - Coordination with network management and understanding the process to resume HA functionality are essential to ensure the continuity of services and network redundancy.
